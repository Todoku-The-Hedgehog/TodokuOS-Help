! ---- TodokuOS stop codes ---- !

You will be finding all the stop codes in the color screens or errors.

1 - TASK_INCOMPATIBLE_APP:
This error code appears when an application/task is runned when it is a work in progress or incompatible.
So you will have to wait until the application/task is finished.
If it's finished and you're trying to run the application/task in the Scratch version (posted already),
It doesn't run because scratch doesn't support enough scripts so you will have to use the packed version.
Latest version now (?): TodokuOS version 1680 beta
